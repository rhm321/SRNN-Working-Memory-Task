# SRNN-Working-Memory-Task
This SRNN is built off the work of JakeXXH (https://github.com/Jakexxh/srnn-2afc) and looks to identify how a spiking neural network performs and behaves when given a simple task when it is given of two cues for a 2AFC task (inspired by a biological mouse experiment). Besides offering a greater generalization of Jake's work, the code has been enhaced by being commented out, by taking less RAM to process, and by offering more visualization tools.
